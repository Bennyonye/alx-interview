# 0x02. Minimum Operations

This project involves solving a coding challenge to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach a specific number of characters in a file using only two operations: **Copy All** and **Paste**.

## Problem Description

You are given a text file that initially contains a single character `H`. The text editor you are using has only two available operations:

1. **Copy All**: Copies all the characters in the file.
2. **Paste**: Pastes the characters that were last copied.

Given a number `n`, you need to calculate the fewest number of operations required to have exactly `n` characters in the file.

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters.

    Arguments:
    n (int): The target number of 'H' characters.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of operations needed to get exactly n 'H' characters, or 0 if it is impossible.
    """
```

### Requirements

- **Input**: A positive integer `n`.
- **Output**: The minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters. If `n` cannot be achieved, return `0`.

### Example

```python
>>> minOperations(4)
4

>>> minOperations(9)
6
```

### Explanation

- For `n = 4`: 
  - Start with 1 `H`.
  - Operation 1: Copy All (1 `H` in clipboard).
  - Operation 2: Paste (now have 2 `H`).
  - Operation 3: Copy All (2 `H` in clipboard).
  - Operation 4: Paste (now have 4 `H`).

- For `n = 9`:
  - Start with 1 `H`.
  - Operation 1: Copy All (1 `H` in clipboard).
  - Operation 2: Paste (now have 2 `H`).
  - Operation 3: Copy All (2 `H` in clipboard).
  - Operation 4: Paste (now have 4 `H`).
  - Operation 5: Paste (now have 6 `H`).
  - Operation 6: Paste (now have 9 `H`).

## Strategy to Solve

To minimize the number of operations, we can factorize `n`. Every time you perform a **Copy All**, you need to divide `n` by the largest possible factor, and then repeatedly **Paste** the characters until you reach the exact number of `H` characters.

The idea is to break down `n` into its prime factors and use the sum of those factors as the number of operations.

### Algorithm

1. Start with 1 `H` in the file.
2. Find the prime factorization of `n`.
3. For each prime factor, copy all, and paste the required number of times to achieve the required `H` characters.
4. Return the total number of operations required.

## Edge Cases

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, return `0` as it's impossible to generate exactly `n` characters.
- For prime numbers, the number of operations will be `n` itself.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/alx-interview.git
   ```

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python3 filename.py
   ```

3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
